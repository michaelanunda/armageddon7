SEIR-I Lab 11B — Incident Response (Lambda + API Gateway + RDS)

“The system doesn’t need heroes.
It needs adults.”

What this lab is

Lab 11B simulates a real production incident in a serverless system:

Client → API Gateway → Lambda → RDS

Something breaks.
Not “the whole system.”
One small thing.

Your job is not to panic, redeploy everything, or guess.

Your job is to:
    1. Prove the failure
    2. Collect evidence
    3. Identify the root cause
    4. Recover the system
    5. Prove recovery
    6. Document what happened

That’s it.

This lab does not test how fast you type.
It tests whether you can think clearly under pressure.

Why we are doing this

Most outages are not caused by “bad code.”

They are caused by:
    a missing security-group rule
    a rotated secret
    a wrong environment variable
    a VPC attachment mistake

In serverless systems, you cannot SSH in and poke around.
So your only tools are:
    logs
    configuration
    evidence
    discipline

This lab trains the exact mindset used by:
    Cloud engineers on call
    Incident commanders
    Audit-facing platform teams
    Regulated environments (healthcare, finance, gov)

What “passing” actually means
You do not pass by fixing the issue alone.
You pass only if you can prove, with evidence:
    the system was healthy
    the system failed
    why it failed
    what you changed
    that it is healthy again

That is what separates:

“I fixed it”
from
“I can defend this in front of auditors”

Required: evidence_manifest.json

    Every Lab 11B submission must include an evidence manifest.
    
    This is non-negotiable.
    
    Purpose
    
    The manifest proves:
        what evidence exists
        when it was collected
        that it was not altered
    
    This is how audits, SOC reports, and post-incident reviews work in real companies.

YOU must compute hashes yourself:

sha256sum evidence_11b/* > evidence_11b/hashes.txt

Then copy the correct values into the manifest.

Why this matters:
Auditors assume logs can lie.
Hashes don’t.

Required: Human Notes (No Automation Allowed)

    Automation proves what happened.
    Humans must explain why.
    
    Every student must submit a short written file:

      human_notes_11b.md


Required template

# SEIR-I Lab 11B — Human Incident Notes

## 1. What was the initial symptom?
(What did the user/system experience?)

## 2. What evidence showed the system was failing?
(List specific files, logs, HTTP codes, timestamps.)

## 3. What was the root cause?
(Be precise. One sentence.)

## 4. What change fixed the issue?
(Exactly what was modified.)

## 5. How did you verify recovery?
(What evidence proves it is working again?)

## 6. What would you monitor next time to catch this faster?
(Logs, metrics, alarms.)

No bullet-point fluff.
No guessing.
No blame.

Just facts.

Why this matters for your career

At 2 a.m., nobody cares:
    what tutorial you followed
    what cert you memorized

They care whether you can:
    stay calm
    collect evidence
    fix one thing
    explain it clearly

Lab 11B teaches that muscle.
